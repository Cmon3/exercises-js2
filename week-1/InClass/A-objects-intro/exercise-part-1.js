/*

Think of 5 different real world "things" that you 
can describe with a JavaScript object

Assign each of them to a separate variable


For example:
var car = {
    brand: "Seat",
    model: "Arona",
    color: "white",
    horsepower: 115,
    doors: 5
};

*/

let bike = {
    brand: "Felt",
    model: "F12",
    color: "White",
    weight: "9 kg",
    height: "50 cm"
};

console.log(bike);
